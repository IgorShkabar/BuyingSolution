/// Declaring fields as `public` in C# structs is acceptable and does not violate design principles, provided the struct serves as a simple data container (a Data Transfer Object or a Cohesive Value).
/// In my specific case, since the struct is marked as `internal` and is used exclusively within a single assembly, the use of `public` fields is entirely justified.
/// Why this is acceptable in my scenario:
/// Absence of business logic: 
/// Coordinates (Lat, Lon) and address strings are independent, atomic pieces of data. 
/// There are no validation rules (invariants) here that would require protection through encapsulation.
